The World Factbook Refactored

This is a project for exploring the use of the React framework.

Many thanks to http://www.favicon-generator.org/ for generating the favicon sets I'm using for the site.

The wireframes for the site can be found in the design folder, they were created using Balsamiq.

The Data for the site is taken from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/ summer 2016. 

## Local Development
To enable localhost development I have leveraged the model used in the React tutorial and am using node to host the app.

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```


## TODO List
- Wireframe the content panes
- Create React components
 - Nav tree 
 - Region 
 - Country 
- Format footer 
- Unit testing 
- Analytics
 - Might be worth checking out https://developers.facebook.com/products/analytics 
 - can always fall back on GA
 - Should also add in New Relic
